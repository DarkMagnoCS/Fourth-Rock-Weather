          <p>
            Please check out the seasonal weather report plot for an illustration of missing data and read this article about how dust and distance from the sun affect Insight's power situation.

            NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth plain near Mars’ equator. Please note that there are sometimes problems with the sensors on Mars that result in missing data!

            This page shows the summary data for the last available Sol (Martian Days). As more data from a particular Sol are downlinked from the spacecraft, these values may change.
